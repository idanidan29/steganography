# Steganography Project 🕵️‍♂️🔐

This is an in-progress project aimed at implementing a **steganography** tool to store sensitive information like passwords within images. The project uses **Next.js** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend, offering a full-stack solution for secure data embedding and retrieval.

## Features ✨

- **Image-based Steganography**: Hide sensitive data (e.g., passwords) within image files using steganographic techniques 🎨.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js** and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images, embedding data, and downloading the modified image 🖼️.
- **Backend**: A **Flask** API handles the image processing, encoding, and decoding of hidden messages 🔧.
- **Secure**: Uses encryption methods to ensure that the hidden data is secure and not easily accessible 🔒.

## Technologies 💻

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js 🚀
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling) 🌸
  
- **Backend**:
  - Flask ⚙️
  - Python libraries for image processing and encoding 🐍
