# Steganography Project 🔐

This is a small project aimed at implementing a **steganography** tool to store sensitive information like passwords within images. The project uses **Next.js** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend, offering a full-stack solution for secure data embedding and retrieval.

You can try out the project at [lockpixel.vercel.app](https://lockpixel.vercel.app/).🚀

## Features ✨

- **Image-based Steganography**: Hide sensitive data (e.g., passwords) within image files using steganographic techniques 🎨.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js** and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images, embedding data, and downloading the modified image 🖼️.
- **Backend**: A **Flask** API handles the image processing, encoding, and decoding of hidden messages 🔧.
