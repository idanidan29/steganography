                    <p>
                        Steganography is the technique of hiding information inside a file, such as an image, audio, or video,
                        without making it obvious. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable to outsiders,
                        steganography conceals data in a way that looks completely normal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This method is widely used for secure communication, digital watermarking, and protecting sensitive information.
                        In our application, we use steganography to safely store passwords inside images,
                        keeping them hidden from unauthorized access while still being easily retrievable when needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the hidden data is invisible to the human eye, steganography provides an extra layer of security.
                        Even if someone gains access to the image, they wonâ€™t immediately suspect that it contains sensitive information.
                        This makes it a powerful tool for keeping passwords safe and private.
